## Project Brainstorm Questions

#### Why are you interested in this field/domain?
We are interested in how different industries react to the adjustments of Federal interest rates. For instance, when the Federal Reserve reduces interest rate, how would the US housing market react. We plan to measure the magnitude of industry reaction through measuring the movements of their index funds in the US stock market corresponding to the time frame of interest rate adjustment by the US Federal Reserve.
