                      <h3> Project Explanation </h3>
                      <body>
                      <br>
                      Throughout this project, we attempted to find a correlation between federal fund rate changes and different NYSE industry stock performance.
                      </br>
                      <br>
                      The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which banks borrow money from the fed. This number will often affect almost every other aspect of the economy in various ways. 
                      </br>
                      <br>
                      Typically, the Federal Reserve Board (The Fed) will change this underlying rate to counteract recession or inflation. If the economy appears to be in a downturn or Bear Market, the fed will often lower interest rates to make borrowing more appealing to banks, companies, and consumers in order to stimulate the economy. This can have one or two effects on different industries stock performance. First, investors will be encouraged by the Fedâ€™s move and will put more money into the market, causing investment vessel prices to rise. Second, investors could become concerned the market will be turning bear quickly and begin to pull money out consistently, causing market prices to tank. 
                      </br>
                      <br>
                      As clearly seen above, knowing exactly what the stock market like the NYSE will do during rate changes is impossible to predict. However, we believe that we can find a more accurate answers by looking at specific industries rather than the market as a whole.

                      <li> 
                      We found that there is definitely a correlation between Federal Funds Rate changes and stock performance. In all of the funds that we viewed, there is either a large dip or clime in price or activity whenever monetary policy is changed in a major way.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                      In times of recession when the Fed is lowering rates, Real Estate investment prices often drop the most. Consumer Goods are the safest investment as there is the least amount of reactivity.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                      When the economy is inflated and growing rapidly, Healthcare and Technology is the best place for investors to store their money, according to our data. These two experience the most growth while real estate and consumer goods are definitely more of a slow growth investment.

                      The federal funds rate data that we chose to use comes from the St. Louis Fed website. The St. Louis Fed is a commonly used government data collection site. We filtered the results down to show only 2006 to 2019. This is a substantial amount of time that captures many ups and downs with FFR changes.

                      <br>
                      The market industry data that we selected comes from Yahoo Finance. The site allows us to select a date range which we matched to our FFR data. Wed selected a wide variety of industries that capture many different areas of the market including:

                                In this graph we visualize the changes between adjusted day close price and updates in the Federal Funds Rate. In 2008, the Mortgage Crisis forced the Federal Reserve board to cut rates drastically down to almost zero in order to stimulate consumer spending. All funds pictured in the graph reacted negatively to the shift. 
                                </br>
                                <br>
                                In 2016, the Federal Reserve board began to raise rates once again, a sign of sturdy economic growth, and instantaneously, we are able to see stocks react in a very positive manner.
                                </br>
                                <br>
                                Consumer Goods saw the biggest jump when rates were raised once again. This is surprising because this industry typically is slower growth and less reactive to outside factors, hence their lower Beta score (a measure of reactivity).

                                This chart visualizes the differences in trading volume over several years. Since the different funds have different average levels of activity, it is important to view the chart on a common size basis (look at proportions, not necessarily the numeric values).

                                <br>
                                Trading volume is one of the best and most underrated tells of the success or failure of stock price. It is essentially the number of buys or sells of a stock on a given day; in other words, the activity. On days when significant economic events occur, trading volume typically skyrockets as a reaction.

                                <br>
                                As mentioned in previous tabs, there are two main economic events that we are looking at: the extreme rate cuts in 2008 and the long-awaited rate raise in 2016. One of the most notable volume changes occurred in the Real Estate sector in 2008. It appears that there was an absolutely massive selloff following rate cuts and the mortgage crisis. Also, Technology typically does best when rates are raised according to our visualization.

                                The fluctuation rate is the difference between opening price and closing price for a single trading day. In this visualization we picture which funds showed the most reactivity to Federal Funds Rate changes. Since the funds trade at different prices, it is important to look at the differences between highs and lows rather than the numeric values shown on the Y Axis.

                                What we found with this analysis is that rate changes do indeed have an effect on the funds fluctuation rates. It is seen most clearly in Real Estate, as there are very large price differences for the fund on days when rates are changed.
